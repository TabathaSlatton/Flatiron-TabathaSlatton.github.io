### Routes are a Puzzle:
       Routes and I have had an interesting relationship. During the learn.co lessons, this has been the most challenging topic. I am an incredibly determined person so hitting a wall with these was very unfortunate for me, but it also made me even more determined to understand them. While the lessons were clear, I was just not getting it. This is why I love FlatIron so much. Right after this incredibly challenging topic, we had a project. Project weeks are my favorite weeks so far. I have to reach back into the documentation to remind myself about specific strategies and put my knowledge to the ultimate test. This project really cemented routes for me. I feel renewed and excited to get started on mod 3!  

### There's more than one way to skin a cat:
       One of my favorite things so far when it comes to programming is that there are soooo many ways to solve a problem. I am usually a huge rule follower and the kind of person who does things one way. I love that programming is changing that in me. I am always looking for the most efficient way to do something, but the fact that even efficiency is something that can be handled in multiple ways keeps things super interesting. Seeing the same thing done in multiple ways from multiple people helps me see why that thing works and understand the meaning behind it so much more. 

### You get out what you put in:
      Even moreso than any other week, project week is what you make of it. Anyone attending a coding bootcamp is sacrificing a lot to be here. Family time, money, and current jobs are just some of the things that it costs. We owe it to ourselves to make the most out of every single day here. This is work that could effect the rest of our lives if we allow it to. With that in mind every day, I was able to meet the basic requires (the MVP) by Wednesday and continue to tinker with it the rest of the week. Even meeting the MVP, you learn a lot and put a lot of what you have learned into practice. The time doing even just a little bit extra is incredibly valuable and highly encouraging. The product is never done, there's always more to do, but doing even one or two extra things feels incredible and helps you learn a lot.

### Wait, I can do this:
     What? I made a website?! Sure, it functions like it was made in the nineties, but *I did it*. Even more than the CLI project, this was an incredible feeling the entire time. I know I have a lot to learn (a fact I'm thrilled about, actually), but I'm soaking it all in and making the most of every minute.

### It's okay not to be a lone wolf:
     I lone wolfed it during the CLI project. I did not go to office hours, and to be honest I didn't talk to too many of my peers during that project. I decided this time to step a little bit out of my comfort zone and my project was all the better for it. Even more important, I learned a lot more from doing that. This was kind of the glue to all of the other pieces. I was able to see different ways people were solving problems, I was able to connect with others to understand routes and other issues, and I was able to ask a quick question or two so I didn't spend hours stuck because of a syntax error or another small problem. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, I was also able to appriciate the work other people in my cohort were doing. These are remarkable people who are incredibly talented and intelligent. I can grow so much by learning with/from them. For this, I am grateful.
