While every project in Flatiron is vastly different, throughout every project, I found one major commonality within myself: Brainstorming. Brainstorming is a POWERFUL tool that can make the rest of your project build a lot smoother and give you the time to push yourself further. Below I will guide you through my process of brainstorming. Something very important to understand, however, is that brainstorming is very unique to the individual and what works for me might not necessarily be the best process for you. Feel free to try out some of my ideas, make them your own, or try something else. Brainstorming is a beautiful and unique process!

## Narrowing Down Ideas

The very first step I take when I embark on another project is narrowing down ideas. This is definitely more necessary in personal projects than professional projects. Inspiration can strike anywhere! Having a journal or google doc to jot down project ideas as you go so you don't lose them can be very helpful with this step. If you're struggling to come up with ideas and need some inspiration [check out this video](https://youtu.be/oluY633rkgI/) from youtuber Web Dev Simplified to learn about projects that would be very helpful in your portfolio. 

#### Category

Using the video referenced above, for my last few projects I've focused on a category of project to work on. Do I want a social media page, a banking app, a storefront? I want to make sure my portfolio is as diverse as possible so I push myself to try a different category or a new feature within a category each project.

#### Theme

When I have a category of project chosen, I think about themes that inspire me. This is where I take the project and make it my own, unique to my interests. There are endless possiblilites here and I highly encourage you to make sure to spend time thinking about what interests you. While working with other developers, I've found those working on a personal project "just to have it" versus based on something they're genuniely excited about are less excited throughout the entire project and it shows. With something so self-driven as a personal project, it needs to be exciting to you. 

#### Inspiration

Once I have my category and theme chosen, I crack my knuckels are start digging in. I start finding inspiration from other webpages and jot down ideas mentally or in a google doc of basic feature I know I must have. While doing this, I think about how I want my project to stand out. For example, while working on a fitness (theme) social media (category) webpage, I explored websites such as Facebook, Twitter, MyFitnessPal, and numerous smaller websites. I learned what I liked about them, what I would want to change for my own page, and it helped solidify and narrow my ideas. 

#### User Stories

If you take away anything from this article, let it be this paragraph. User stories are vital to the brainstorming process. Who is going to use your webpage? The most obvious answer is "users"....well, yes. Now that we have that established, we need to get in the heads of our users. We need to think about how they will interact with our website. An example of a single user stories might be "User can log in". This lets me as a developer know a lot about what I need to do and where I can go from there.
Personally, I like to create my user stories in tiers. The first tier is what I will need for my MVP (Minimum Viable Product), the second tier consists of stretch goals, and the final tier is a list of dream features to have. These help me focus my priorities and feel accomplished as I tick items off my list. I definitely consider these tiers fluid as sometimes while working on the project, something that seemed like a must have may turn into a stretch goal or vice versa. 

#### User Flow Diagram

Last, but definitely not least for narrowing down ideas...pull out your crystal ball it's time for.... User Flow Diagram. Using a tool such as lucid chart, draw.io, or even pen and paper, this is where you think about every step the user will take while using your website. Map out the paths they will take so you know how to map those out and make user flow a breeze. 



##### Final Note

Development is cyclical. It's perfectly okay to be well into the brainstorming and change the category or theme. It's okay to tweak your user stories well into development. As we design, implement, and test our websites, ideas change and improve. Take a deep breath, slam down a coffee, and keep on going.
