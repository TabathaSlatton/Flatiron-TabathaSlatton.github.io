Pair Programming is a marvelous thing. During my Javascript/Rails project, I really got to experience some of the benefits of pair programming with one of my peers. We worked together for most of our project and it lead to the best projects either of us have made so far in our journey.

### What is Pair Programming?

There is a difference between programming next to each other and pair programming. In a previous project, my peer and I pretty much exclusively programmed next to each other. During this project, while we mostly programmed next to each other, we did solve a few problems with the method of pair programming. When you are pair programming, one person is driving while the other is navigating. One typing, while the other is thinking aloud the steps they might take. On our most challenging problems, this is the method we chose to solve them, rotating who was the driver and navigator based on whose project we were looking at. When we had the same project, we essentially switched off based on who was more comfortable with which role.

### Benefits of Pair Programming

1. **Two heads are better than one.**  Combining our knowledge and understanding of learn.co material and outside material led to us solving problems faster since each person thinks differently.
2.  **Conversations about code.** Learning something new alone and from home can be incredibly daunting. Having another person around to talk about code helps us practice the vocabulary of the trade and reasoning out problems aloud with someone who has a different perspective aids in retention of the material. 
3.  **Less syntax errors.**  While coding with someone else, it's easier to pick up on syntax errors and errors in general due to the above two items on this list. It can be frusturating to realize that something wasn't working due to a simple syntax error so having an extra set of eyes can make the process a bit smoother.
4.  **Constructive criticism.** This one is both for pair programming and just having someone to work with in general, but having  someone available to provide constructive criticism can be very helpful.  Constructive criticism, as long as it's constructive, is vital in the development of any kind of project. Having another eye and perspective is incredibly important as you can easily not notice issues in a project you've been working on alone.
5.  **Bonus: fun.** Working with another person is fun. When you trust the other person it makes all of the above possible and can potentially lead to fun little music brain breaks. *Musical brain breaks and quality of vocals not guarenteed.*
