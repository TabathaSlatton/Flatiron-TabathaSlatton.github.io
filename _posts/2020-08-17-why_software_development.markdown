<p>After much consideration and many hours of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript practice, I am extremely excited to get started with my journey into the software development career path. There are many reasons for which I know this is the right choice for my life. They all boil down to one: coding is a blast and I love it.</p>
		 
<p>One of the first things I noticed about the software development career path is that the job outlook is pretty fantastic. There are a ton of possibilities in many different fields. Examples include education, game development, websites, robotics, and many others. With so many options, flexibility is a key factor. At this early stage, I don't know for certain which of the countless areas of software development I'm most interested in, but I do know one thing: I want to be coding. </p>
		 
 <p>I am obsessed with learning. I'm at my best, most happy self when I am tackling new problems and perfecting my craft. With the complex nature of software development and the fact that technology is ever-changing, I have no doubts that I can always find something more to learn and a more efficient way of doing things. Breaking a complex problem down into smaller pieces and solving them is a skill I have that I believe will help me in this field. I have such a great time taking all of the information I have learned and applying it to problems. In this early stage, I have very much enjoyed using Code Wars to practice the skills I've learned and applying JavaScript to logical problems. The rush of joy I feel when I get my tests to pass in either a project or a coding challenge lets me know I am making the right decision. </p>
		 
<p>Continuing the idea of learning, I've found that I learn best with a collaborative environment. I want to be able to share my thinking as well as hear the clever ideas others have. During my teaching career, I prided myself on my ability to learn from others and adapt their practices into my own. I found that collaboration was the key to success and I strongly believe that this skillset is vital to the software development field as well. All of this being said, I am ready to get started! Let's do this thing!</p>
