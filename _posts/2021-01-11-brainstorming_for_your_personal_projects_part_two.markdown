Now that we have [narrowed down ideas for our personal projects](https://tabathaslatton.github.io/brainstorming_for_your_personal_projects_part_one), let's discuss two more brainstorming strategies: mock-ups and drawing out models. Just to remind you, these are the steps that I take with my personal projects, but brainstorming is not a one-size fits all system. Try new things and find what works for you! As a bonus, I've included some helpful external resources at the bottom that include systems I use or that others find helpful. 

### Mock-Up

Previously, we've browsed inspriational web pages and made notes about all of the wonderful things they're doing and all of the not as wonderful things that we'd personally change in our own projects. I hope you kept these notes handy! It's time to create a mock-up for our own website. My favorite tool for this: google slides. Whether you are a lone worker bee or you have a whole colony of bees, google slides allows you to share your designs with whomever you wish, with or without editing power. [Here's an example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yMFn0jMwUv10G_-POlSUQOB-He-PHEADR9v3nIG5PCI/edit?usp=sharing) of my mockup on my latest project. There are tons of shapes and designs you can do within slides that help you visualize what you're aiming to accomplish with your project.

While creating your mockup, make sure to reference your user stories, user flow diagram, and have fun playing around with different designs and color schemes. Think about what makes your project unique and use that to your benefit! 

Mock-ups are a great chance to refine your user stories as well as your overall ideas.  I do my mock-ups before drawing out my models because I'm a very visual person. Having a mockup helps me visualize what I'm looking for in features, user stories, flow and relationships. While creating my mock-up, I tend to go back regularly to the previous steps in my brainstorming and flesh out and/or narrow ideas.

### Drawing Out Models

Other than user stories, this is one of the most important brainstorming tools I use regularly. Drawing out my models helps me visualize the backend of my project and refine the relationships between my models. It enables me to think about how each piece is connected as well as what data I will need for each model before I jump into the project head first. This makes my job a lot easier once I do finally delve into the code and provides we with an easy reference to use during my project development.
